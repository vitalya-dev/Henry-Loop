These are the Hyper Light Drifter Sprites that were found in the binary "HyperLightDrifter.exe"

Enjoy, courtest of Bawbby.

FAQ (I guess):

Q: How did you extract the sprites?
A: A little bit to explain but the sprites are embedded inside the executable itself.
I originaly started using a hex editor to look through the exe.
I'd presumed the images are in PNG format so I looked out for the header of the PNG and the end chunk.
More info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics in the File format section.
I'd then copy and pasted the beginning and end offsets of the image and saved it as a PNG.

Q: How long did it take?
A: Probably 20 minutes, I wrote a python script to read the binary and copy and export the PNGs from the exe.

Any questions or missing stuff?
